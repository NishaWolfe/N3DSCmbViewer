How to build
=======
Add and build the [Aglex repository](https://github.com/NishaWolfe/Aglex)

Install OpenTK 3 for .NET Framework 4.x. (Tools --> NuGet Package Manager --> Package Manager Console --> `Install-Package OpenTK -Version 3.3.1`)



Warning
=======

__This is unfinished, experimental code.__ You _will_ encounter glitches, broken functionality, etc., etc. Do not _expect_ anything related to OoT3D/MM3D (models, animation, archives, etc.) to work and be happy if something _does_. There should, however, _not_ be any problems just running the application.

Also note that this repository supersedes [the old source code archive](http://magicstone.de/dzd/random/3ds/N3DSCmbViewer-bin-src.rar) posted in 2014, before this repository existed.
